== What is Rabbit?

Rabbit is a presentation tool for programmer, especially
Rubyist.

You can create presentation slides as a text format. So you
can use your favorite editor and version control system for
creating presentation slides.

Rabbit has programmer-friendly keybord interface. If you
type a key then you will get what you want because Rabbit
uses Emacs/Vi like key bindings by default.

You can just use Rabbit as a slide viewer because Rabbit can
also show PDF format slide. You can create by Keynote or
what you like and use Rabbit as a slide viewer for
programmer-friendly keybord interface.

You can customize slide look and feed by Ruby. It's very
important for Rubyist that you can program when you make
presentation slides.

=== Format

Rabbit supports RD and Wiki notation for text format.

((<rd.html/RD>)) is an abbreviation of Ruby Document. It's
easy to read text format.

Rabbit supports a ((<hiki.html/Hiki notation>)) that is a
dialect of Wiki notations.

=== Interface

Rabbit has useful slide operation interface.

  * Keybord interface: If you type a key then you will get
    what you want.
  * Mouse gesture: Just for a fun. It'll not be used while
    presentation but it's fun while creating.
  * Here and tortoise: Visualize remaining time.
